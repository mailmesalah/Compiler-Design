See the attached files (actual project, sample program, sample input/output text files which shows how the program should function). The objective is to code lexical analyzer in java based on the DFA drawn. Based on the DFA, need to add 9 more and then code it. I have also attached a sample program that can be used as a reference and will help accomplish the task. I need this completed by Tuesday (3/5/13), in case there are problems we will work it out. Also keep in mind, there will be 3 other projects that will be based on this 1st project.
